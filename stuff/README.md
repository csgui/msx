# MSX Low-Level Programming Playground

Welcome to the **MSX Low-Level Programming Playground**! This repository is an experiment and learning space dedicated to exploring low-level software development on classic, resource-constrained hardware, specifically the MSX home computer platform.

## Why MSX?
- **Retro challenge**: The MSX environmentâ€™s limited CPU speed, memory, and I/O capabilities offer a fun and educational constraint that forces you to think in terms of cycles, bytes, and hardware details.
- **Historical relevance**: MSX was a popular 8-bit standard in the 1990s, with a rich ecosystem of games and tools. Learning to code at its level gives insight into how early software was built.
- **Joy of simplicity**: Stripping away modern abstractions brings us back to the core pleasures of programming: direct hardware access, hand-crafted algorithms, and real-time performance tuning.

## Goals
- Provide examples of Z80 assembly and C code targeting MSX-DOS .COM binaries and ROM cartridges.
- Demonstrate techniques for bootstrapping, memory layout, I/O routines, and debugging on MSX.
- Encourage experimentation with minimal toolchains (SDCC, SDASz80, hex2bin) and MSX emulators.
